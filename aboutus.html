      Hi There! This To-Do app has been developed by Gani and Mamun, and we are
      two young IT apprentices. We are both students at the TBZ Zurich and are
      currently in our third year of apprenticeship. <br>
      At the moment we arevattending the IT module 133 in which the main focus is based on web
      applications. In this module, we are working on a final project in which
      we have to design and develop a functioning To Do app with all the
      necessary features that are common in this kind of app. <br>
      The development of the app itself was quite challenging for us and especially the time frame
      was a bit short, which didn't allow us much flexibility to implement other
      features that we had in mind. Especially towards the end, we were running
      out of time, but nevertheless we are convinced that we were able to
      accomplish this project very well. So at the end of the day, we are very
      proud of the final To Do app and really hope that you enjoy using it. If
      you have any feedback or improvement ideas, please feel free to contact us.
    </p>
